As in all other computer languages, the elements of Java do not exist in isolation. Rather,
they work together to form the language as a whole. However, this interrelatedness can
make it difficult to describe one aspect of Java without involving several others. Often a
discussion of one feature implies prior knowledge of another.
For this reason, this chapter presents a quick overview of several key features of Java. The material described here will
give you a foothold that will allow you to write and understand simple programs. Most of
the topics discussed will be examined in greater detail in the remaining chapters of Part I.
